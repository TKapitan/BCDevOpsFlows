# Determine Packages

Determine Packages using configured build method (NuGet or BCContainerHelper)
NuGet
 - Find correct artifact URL based on the project setup. 
BCContainerHelper
 - Find and download all NuGet packages required to build the app.

## INPUT Parameters

No input parameters.

## ENV INPUT variables

| Name                  | Description |
| :--                   | :-- |
| AL_SETTINGS           | BCDevOpsFlows settings as specified and generated by the ReadSettings. This should be always generated by pipeline by running ReadSettings step. |
| AL_DEBUG | If set to 'true', pipelines generate additional logs that provides better details. If requesting support, you must provide log generated when this variable is enabled. |

## ENV INPUT variables used only when AL_RUNWITH is NuGet

| Name | Description |
| :--                   | :-- |
| AL_NUGETINITIALIZED   | If not set to true, the step fails. |
| AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL | Specifies details about nuget feeds to be used to retrieve dependencies. You do not need to include Microsoft NuGet feeds as they are included automatically. See chapter below for details about the content. In default setup, configure AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS variable in your library and pass it to AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL variable in yaml file (secret variables must be explicitly configured in yaml files). |

### AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS / AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL example

**The variable must be compressed JSON!** The example below is structured json only for better readability. Scripts use AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL. You should define AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS as secret variable in your library and pass it to AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL in yaml files. Secret variables must be explicitly specified in yaml files, otherwise they are no available in pipeline.

```powershell
[
    {
        "Name":"---Feed 1 Name---",
        "Url":"---Feed 1 Url---",
        "Token":"---Feed 1 Token (with Read permission)---"
    },
    {
        "Name":"---Feed 2 Name---",
        "Url":"---Feed 2 Url---",
        "Token":"---Feed 2 Token (with Read permission)---"
    }
]
```

## ENV INPUT variables used only when AL_RUNWITH is BCContainerHelper

| AL_BCCONTAINERHELPERPATH | If specified and valid, system will not download and import a new BCContainerHelper. This is usually configured in the background to prevent downloading/importing bccontainerhelper in every step. |

## ENV OUTPUT variables

| Name | Description |
| :--                   | :-- |
| AL_ALLOWPRERELEASE   | If set to true, pipeline will use public releases as well as preview/prerelease builds. |

## ENV OUTPUT variables generated only when AL_RUNWITH is BCContainerHelper

| Name | Description |
| :--                   | :-- |
| AL_SETTINGS       | Compressed json file with BCDevOpsFlows settings.     |
| AL_ARTIFACT | The ArtifactUrl to use for the build |
| AL_BCCONTAINERHELPERPATH  | Path to used BC Container Helper module.  |
