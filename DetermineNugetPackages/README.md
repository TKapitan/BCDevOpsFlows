## ENV INPUT variables

| Name                  | Description |
| :--                   | :-- |
| AL_NUGETINITIALIZED   | If not set to true, the step fails. |
| AL_SETTINGS           | BCDevOpsFlows settings as specified and generated by the ReadSettings. This should be always generated by pipeline by running ReadSettings step. |
| AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL | Specifies details about nuget feeds to be used to retrieve dependencies. You do not need to include Microsoft NuGet feeds as they are included automatically. See chapter below for details about the content. In default setup, configure AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS variable in your library and pass it to AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL variable in yaml file (secret variables must be explicitly configured in yaml files). |
| AL_DEBUG | If set to 'true', pipelines generate additional logs that provides better details. If requesting support, you must provide log generated when this variable is enabled. |

### AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS / AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL example

**The variable must be compressed JSON!** The example below is structured json only for better readability. Scripts use AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL. You should define AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS as secret variable in your library and pass it to AL_TRUSTEDNUGETFEEDS_INTERNAL in yaml files. Secret variables must be explicitly specified in yaml files, otherwise they are no available in pipeline.

```powershell
[
    {
        "Name":"---Feed 1 Name---",
        "Url":"---Feed 1 Url---",
        "Token":"---Feed 1 Token (with Read permission)---"
    },
    {
        "Name":"---Feed 2 Name---",
        "Url":"---Feed 2 Url---",
        "Token":"---Feed 2 Token (with Read permission)---"
    }
]
```
