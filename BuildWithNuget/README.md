- BCDevOps Flows currently does not support
  - Building against specific version of Business Central
  - Building against next-minor/major
  - Building against non-W1 localization
- BCDevOps Flows can only support what is supported by Microsoft. For this reason, BCDevOps Flows cannot run tests using NuGets as it requires container.
